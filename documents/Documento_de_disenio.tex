\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Overview}

The purpose of this document is to describe the design of the "Particle Simulator" project. This document will describe the architecture, components, and design decisions of the project.

\subsection{Scope}

The project consists of creating a particle simulator, where there are different types of particles such as water, fire, earth, air, etc. Each of these particles will have different behaviors; some will have a higher density than others, some will evaporate upon contact with fire, others will freeze upon contact with water, etc. The objective of the project is to simulate the behavior of these particles in a 2D environment.
